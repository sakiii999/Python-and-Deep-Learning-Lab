Much of what we know about the Venom F5 are the stats that Hennessey Special Vehicles, the small company behind the car, has already shared. Teased for nearly a full year at this point, the Hennessey Venom F5’s 1,600 horsepower twin turbo V8 is supposedly capable of pushing the car to 301 miles per hour. The company’s founder, John Hennessey, said in a statement, “It’s no question of if we will break 300 mph but a question of when.” (More on this in a moment.)Is there meaning, or value, for most people in any of these ridiculous numbers? Hell no. These are cars that we all will (probably) never be able to buy or even be able to drive, and if we were, reaching 300 miles per hour is essentially impossible without closing down a long stretch of straight highway. Many good arguments have been made about the work required to reach speeds like 300 miles per hour, and how solving problems like stopping the tires from blowing apart matters just as much as building the car in the first place. Whether a hyper-exclusive company like Hennessey, which was accused of potentially sketchy business behavior back in 2016, can be the one to figure this stuff out remains to be seen.All the companies making these ludicrous cars are working at or near what is essentially the ceiling of performance for road cars in general, as well as the limit of what the human body and mind can withstand behind the wheel. They do it because it makes for great marketing, but also because it might be one of the only ways to sell someone a multimillion dollar car. I may be a bit jealous of the rich jerks who wind up owning or driving these cars, and in some weird way I’m glad they’re financing these crazy ideas. Of course, like with many bold promises, there’s always a chance that they’re getting taken for a ride, even as they sit behind the wheel.
